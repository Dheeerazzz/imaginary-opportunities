# Imaginary Opportunities

Welcome to Imaginary Opportunities, the job board where you can find exciting and unique job openings with your favorite fictional characters. From mythical creatures and enchanted forests to futuristic cities and distant galaxies, our listings offer a wide range of opportunities for those looking to pursue their dream careers in the world of imagination.

### First, a few rules:

1. Please keep the tone of your job post lighthearted and funny.
2. No duplicates. Please check the list before creating your pull request.
3. One job post per pull request.

### How the job listings were created:

This project utilized OpenAI and ChatGPT to generate the content for each job listing separately. We hope you will try this method also, it's very easy! (We'll give you a quick walkthrough below) However, if absolutely feel led to write the job post yourself, feel free.

## Contribution Guide:

1.  Go to the ChatGPT website (<https://www.chatgpt.com/>) and create an account. This will allow you to generate job listings using the ChatGPT AI.
2.  In the input field on the ChatGPT website, type or paste the following text: "Write an entry-level frontend developer job listing where you'll be working for [Your job goes here]". You can add "Make it funny" at the end of this text if you want the job listing to have a humorous tone.
3.  Click the "Send" button to generate a response from ChatGPT. This will be a job listing written in natural language.
4.  Review the job listing generated by ChatGPT and select the one you want to use. Copy the text of the job listing to your clipboard.
5.  Go to the HTML Cleaner website (<https://html-cleaner.com/>) and paste the text of the job listing into the left-hand input field. This will convert the text into HTML code that can be used on a website.
6.  Review the HTML code generated by HTML Cleaner and make any necessary edits or changes.
7.  Once you are satisfied with the HTML code for your job listing, copy it to your clipboard.
8.  Go to the GitHub page for this project ([https://github.com/[user]/[project]](https://github.com/%5Buser%5D/%5Bproject%5D)) and click the "Fork" button at the top of the page. This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account, which you can use to make changes.
9.  Clone the forked repository to your local computer using the `git clone` command and the URL of your forked repository. This will create a local copy of the project on your computer that you can edit.
10. Install the necessary packages for the project by running `npm install` in the project directory.
11. Create a new page file in the `frontend` folder: `pages\listings\frontend\new-file.js`. The name of the file will be used as part of the URL path for the job listing, so choose a descriptive and unique name.
12. Copy the contents of the example page file (`pages\listings\frontend\example\example.js`) into your new page file, or add the following code:

Copy code

```js
import Link from "next/link";

const Listing = () => {
	return (
		<section className="listing">
			<Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
			<p>
				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			{/* Your job listing code from HTML Cleaner goes here */}
		</section>
	);
};

export default Listing;
```

13. Replace the `/* Your job listing code from HTML Cleaner goes here */` comment in the code with the HTML code for your job listing that you copied from HTML Cleaner. Save the file.
14. Open the `index.js` file (`pages\index.js`) and add a new link to your job listing page. You can add the link anywhere in the list of links, and it will be automatically alphabetized.

`<Link href="/listings/frontend/yourFileName">Awesome Job</Link>`

15. Open the project in a web browser and navigate to the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`).
16. Check that your new job listing appears on the homepage and that the link to it works correctly.
17. Use the `git add` command to stage your changes for committing. For example, if you added a new page file and modified the `index.js` file, you would use the following command: `git add pages\listings\frontend\new-file.js pages\index.js`
18. Use the `git commit` command to commit your changes to the local repository. Include a descriptive message with the commit that explains the changes you made. For example: `git commit -m "Added new frontend developer job listing"`
19. Use the `git push` command to push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub. For example: `git push origin`
20. Go to the GitHub page for the original project and click the "Pull requests" tab. Then click the "New pull request" button.
21. In the "Comparing changes" section, make sure that the base fork is the original project and the head fork is your forked repository.
22. In the "Pull request" section, give your pull request a title and a brief description of the changes you made.
23. Click the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request for review.
24. Wait for the project maintainers to review your changes and either merge them into the project or provide feedback on how to improve them.

Once your changes have been merged into the main project, they will be available to anyone who uses the project. Congratulations on making your first contribution to an open source project on GitHub!
