				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a fan of mushrooms and jumping down pipes? Do you have a passion
				for frontend development? Then we have the perfect job for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Mario and Luigi are looking for a skilled frontend developer to join
				their team. In this role, you'll work closely with our plumbers to
				create engaging and dynamic web experiences for our loyal fans.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be successful in this role, you must have a strong understanding of
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You should also be familiar with responsive
				design and cross-browser compatibility. Bonus points if you know how to
				code a platform game or two!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're up for the challenge, apply now and become part of the Mario
				and Luigi family. Just remember, it's not all fun and games - there will
				be some hard work and challenging tasks along the way. But hey, at least
				you'll get to eat as many mushrooms as you want.
			</p>
			<p>
				So grab your red cap and your overalls, and get ready to jump into a
				world of frontend development with Mario and Luigi. We can't wait to
				hear from you!
