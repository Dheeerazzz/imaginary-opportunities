				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Attention all aspiring frontend developers! Are you tired of the same
				old Earth-bound job listings? Well, we have a unique opportunity for you
				- a position as a frontend developer on the Moon!
			</p>
			<p>
				That's right, we're looking for a talented developer to join our team at
				MoonBase Alpha and help us build out the user interface for our lunar
				colonization efforts. We're a fast-paced and innovative team, and we
				need someone who can keep up with our lunar-sized ambitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll be responsible for designing and implementing
				user-friendly interfaces for a variety of applications, from lunar rover
				control panels to space suit maintenance systems. You'll also have the
				chance to work with cutting-edge technologies like MoonScript and
				LunarCSS.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking for someone with strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills,
				as well as a sense of humor (after all, living on the Moon can be pretty
				monotonous). Bonus points if you have experience working with
				low-gravity environments or have a background in astronautics.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're ready to take your career to new heights (literally), apply
				now for the position of Frontend Developer on the Moon! We can't wait to
				hear from you.
			</p>
