				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a master of HTML and CSS, with a keen eye for design and a
				thirst for power? Do you have what it takes to become the next Frontend
				Developer for Diablo, the Lord of Terror?
			</p>
			<p>
				In this exciting role, you'll be responsible for bringing Diablo's
				nightmarish visions to life on the web. You'll work closely with our
				team of demonic designers to create visually stunning interfaces that
				will send chills down the spine of any mortal who dares to visit our
				site.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the face of our brand, you'll need to be a skilled communicator and
				problem solver, able to work well under pressure in the midst of the
				eternal flames of the Burning Hells. You'll also need to be a team
				player, able to collaborate with other members of the demonic horde to
				deliver high-quality frontend experiences that will terrify and delight
				our devoted followers.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're ready to take your frontend skills to the next level and
				join the ranks of Diablo's minions, apply now! Just be prepared to sign
				your soul over to the Lord of Terror as part of the hiring process.
				(Don't worry, it's just a formality.)
