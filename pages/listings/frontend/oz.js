			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a frontend developer with a passion for magic and wizardry? Look
				no further! The Wizard of Oz is seeking an entry-level frontend
				developer to join our team in the Emerald City.

				In this role, you will be responsible for creating magical user
				experiences for our website and online portals. You will work closely
				with our team of munchkins and flying monkeys to bring the wizard's
				vision to life.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are looking for someone with strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills,

				today and let us know why you're the perfect candidate to join our team
				of wizarding developers.

				do offer a competitive salary and a friendly work environment.
