				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a budding frontend developer ready to embark on the quest of a
				lifetime? Look no further, for King Arthur is in search of a hero to
				join his court as the newest member of the frontend development team.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer at King Arthur's court, you will work closely
				with the legendary knights of the round table to design and develop
				stunning user experiences for the kingdom's website and web
				applications. You will be responsible for bringing the Arthurian legends
				to life on the web, using your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
				create magical interfaces that will transport users to the world of
				Camelot.
			</p>
			<p>
				But beware, this is not a job for the faint of heart. You must be
				willing to brave the perils of cross-browser compatibility and the
				trials of responsive design in order to succeed. And when the Black
				Knight comes knocking, you must be ready to stand tall and defend the
				kingdom's honor with your code.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you think you have what it takes to join King Arthur's court, please
				send us your CV and a cover letter detailing your experience in frontend
				development, as well as a sample of your code. A sense of humor is also
				a plus, as the knights of the round table are known to be quite the
				jesters. May the best developer win!
