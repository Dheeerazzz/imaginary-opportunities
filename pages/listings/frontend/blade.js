				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking to take a stab at your first frontend developer gig? Look no
				further, because Blade is hiring!
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking for a sharp and witty individual to join our team of
				talented developers. Your main responsibilities will include slicing and
				dicing our website, crafting killer user interfaces, and wielding your
				coding skills like a ninja.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have a sharp eye for design and a knack for making websites look
				sleek and stylish, we want you! Bonus points if you can make a website
				look sharp without using a single blade.
			</p>
			<p>
				But don't worry, we're not all work and no play here at Blade. Our
				office is full of fun and quirky individuals who love to have a good
				time. We even have a foosball table and a fully stocked snack bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're ready to take the next step in your career and join the
				ranks of the Blade team, send us your resume and let us know why you're
				the perfect fit for the job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: Please do not actually bring any real blades to the interview.
				We're all about fun and games, but safety is our number one priority.
