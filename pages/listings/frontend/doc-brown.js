				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Do you have a time machine? No? That's okay, because we're looking for a
				frontend developer to join our team at Doc Brown's Lab!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer at Doc Brown's Lab, you'll have the opportunity
				to work on cutting-edge projects that will make even the most dedicated
				Back to the Future fan jealous. Your primary responsibility will be to
				develop and maintain the frontend of our time-traveling DeLorean,
				ensuring that it looks as sleek and futuristic as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll work closely with Doc Brown himself, as well as a
				team of eccentric scientists and inventors. You'll need to be able to
				think on your feet, as our projects can sometimes be unpredictable (just
				like time itself!).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you think you have what it takes to join our team and help us shape
				the future (or the past, depending on how you look at it), please send
				us your resume and a brief message about why you're the perfect fit for
				this job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, and one more thing - make sure you have a valid driver's license.
				You never know where a time machine might take you!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for Doc Brown, you'll be eligible for some truly
				unique benefits. Here are just a few:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unlimited time off to travel through the time continuum</li>
				<li>A company-issued time-traveling DeLorean</li>
				<li>
					The ability to impress your friends by meeting historical figures in
					person
				</li>
				<li>Employee discounts on hoverboards and plutonium</li>
				<li>
					The opportunity to work alongside one of the most brilliant minds in
					history
				</li>
				<li>
					The satisfaction of knowing that you're helping Doc Brown save the
					world (again and again and again)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To be eligible, you'll need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and
				JavaScript, as well as a willingness to tinker with the space-time
				continuum. Bonus points if you have experience building time machines
				out of DeLoreans or can fix a Flux Capacitor with your eyes closed.
