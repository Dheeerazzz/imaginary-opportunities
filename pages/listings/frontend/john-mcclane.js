				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a skilled frontend developer with a passion for action-packed
				websites? Do you want to work for the ultimate hero, John McClane? Then
				this is the job for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking for a talented individual to join our team as a frontend
				developer. In this role, you'll be responsible for creating dynamic and
				engaging user experiences for John McClane's official website. This
				includes designing and implementing web pages, as well as working
				closely with our backend team to ensure smooth functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
				But be warned - this job isn't for the faint of heart. Just like John
				McClane, you'll need to be quick on your feet and able to handle
				high-pressure situations. Whether it's dealing with a pesky hacker or a
				crashed server, you'll need to have the skills and determination to get
				the job done.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're up for the challenge, we want to hear from you. Send us your
				resume and a brief note explaining why you're the perfect candidate for
				this role. And remember - Yippee-ki-yay!
