				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a radical frontend developer looking to make a splash in the
				world of crime-fighting? Do you have a love for pizza and a passion for
				justice? Look no further, because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are
				looking for a new addition to their kickin' team!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for the TMNT, you'll be responsible for building
				and maintaining the user interface of our top-secret underground lair.
				Your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will help ensure that our
				lair's control panel is easy to use, even for a bunch of pizza-loving
				reptiles.
			</p>
			<p>
				But this job isn't just about technical chops - we're looking for a team
				player who can roll with the punches (and the bad puns). So if you're
				ready to join forces with Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael
				and take on the evil Foot Clan, apply now! Just make sure you're cool
				with sharing your slice of pizza with a talking turtle. Cowabunga, dude!
			</p>
