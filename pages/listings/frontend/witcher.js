				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Witcher is looking for a fearless frontend developer to join our
				team of monster hunters and sorcerers. In this role, you'll use your
				coding prowess to create enchanting user experiences for our website and
				web-based applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for the Witcher, you'll need to be skilled in
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some knowledge of popular
				frameworks like React and Angular. You'll also need to be comfortable
				working with our in-house design team to create beautiful, responsive
				layouts that will make our users want to slay some beasts.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to your technical skills, we're looking for someone who can
				handle the high-stress environment of being a Witcher. You'll need to be
				able to think on your feet and make quick decisions, as well as have a
				good sense of humor (after all, being a Witcher can be pretty grim).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're ready to take on the challenge of working for the Witcher,
				please apply with your resume and a brief explanation of why you're the
				perfect candidate for the job. And don't worry, we'll provide all the
				silver swords and potions you'll need to get the job done.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note:&nbsp;"hmm" is not an acceptable response to any of our
				interview questions.
