			<p>
				As a frontend developer at the Twilight Zone, you'll be responsible for
				creating and maintaining the twisted and bizarre website that showcases
				our twisted and bizarre TV show. You'll work closely with our team of
				writers, producers, and directors to bring their wildest dreams to life

			<p>
				If you think you have what it takes to thrive in this wild and
				unpredictable environment, we encourage you to apply today. We can't
