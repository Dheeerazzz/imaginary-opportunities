				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a frontend developer with a passion for funky, suspender-clad
				scientists? Look no further! Steve Urkel is looking for a new addition
				to his team of brilliant minds.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll be responsible for bringing Steve's latest
				inventions to life on the web. From creating responsive, user-friendly
				interfaces to implementing cutting-edge technology, no project is too
				big (or too goofy) for you to handle.
			</p>
			<p>
				But don't worry, you won't be working alone. Steve's loyal sidekick,
				"Little" Richie, will be there to assist you every step of the way.
				Plus, you'll get to enjoy the perks of working in Steve's
				state-of-the-art laboratory, complete with a lab coat, safety goggles,
				and all the Jell-O you can eat.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're ready to take on the challenge of making Steve's wildest
				dreams a reality, apply now and become a part of the Urkel Industries
				family. "Did I do that?" Yes, you did.
