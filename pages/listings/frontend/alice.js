				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you ready to enter the fantastical world of Alice in Wonderland?
				We're looking for a frontend developer who's as mad as a hatter to join
				our team.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Alice's frontend developer, you'll be responsible for creating and
				maintaining the website that leads visitors down the rabbit hole and
				into our magical land. You'll be working closely with the Cheshire Cat
				to ensure that the site is as enchanting and interactive as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				To qualify, you must be proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
				have a passion for creating beautiful and user-friendly experiences.
				Knowledge of Lewis Carroll's classic tale is a plus, but not required.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're ready to take on this challenge, please send us your
				application and a sample of your best code. We'll be conducting
				interviews via the looking glass, so make sure to bring your tea and
				crumpets.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking forward to seeing what you can do to help us make Alice's
				world even more wonderful!
