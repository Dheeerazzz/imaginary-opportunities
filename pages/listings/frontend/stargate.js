				Are you a frontend developer with a passion for all things Stargate
				SG-1? If so, we want you to join our team as we continue to explore the
				vast universe and protect Earth from hostile alien threats.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for Stargate SG-1, you'll be responsible for
				creating and maintaining the user interface for our top secret
				intergalactic portal. You'll work closely with our team of scientists
				and military personnel to ensure that the portal is always operational
				and ready for the next mission.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll have the opportunity to use your technical skills
				to build and enhance the portal's interface, as well as develop new
				features and functionality to support the team's interdimensional
				travels. You'll also have the opportunity to flex your creative muscles
				by designing graphics and animations for the portal's interface.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be successful in this role, you should have experience with HTML,
				CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a strong understanding of user
				experience and design principles. A passion for sci-fi and Stargate SG-1
				is a must.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're ready to take on the challenge of helping to defend Earth
				from alien threats and explore the universe, apply now and join the
				Stargate SG-1 team! Just be prepared to sign a few NDAs... we can't have
				any Goa'ulds learning our secrets.
