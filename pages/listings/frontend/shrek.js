				In this role, you'll be responsible for creating and maintaining the
				frontend of our website, which is visited by thousands of ogres and
				other swamp creatures every day. You'll need to have a strong

				If you're up for the challenge, we offer a competitive salary, flexible
				hours, and the opportunity to work with some of the most talented and
				lovable creatures in the swamp. Plus, you'll have the satisfaction of
				knowing that your work is helping to spread the word about Shrek and all
				the wonderful things he does.
			</p>

				So if you're a frontend developer who's ready to take on a new challenge
				and make a difference in the swamp, we want to hear from you. Apply
				today and become a part of the Shrek team!
