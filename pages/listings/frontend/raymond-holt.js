				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you a frontend developer who loves Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Captain
				Raymond Holt? Do you have a passion for clean, efficient code and a
				strong desire to make the world a more organized place? If so, we have
				the perfect job for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking for a frontend developer to join our team at the 99th
				Precinct and work with Captain Holt to create user-friendly, visually
				appealing websites and applications. This is a fantastic opportunity to
				use your skills to help us fight crime and make the streets of Brooklyn
				safer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll be responsible for developing frontend code using
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as working with our team of
				developers to create user-friendly interfaces. You'll also have the
				chance to collaborate with Captain Holt and learn from one of the most
				organized and efficient minds in the business.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be considered for this position, you'll need a strong understanding
				of frontend development and a willingness to learn. Experience with
				React, Angular, or Vue is a plus, but not required. Most importantly,
				you'll need a sense of humor and the ability to laugh at Captain Holt's
				many dad jokes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're ready to join the fight against crime and make a real
				difference in the world, apply now!
