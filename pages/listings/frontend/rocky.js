				Are you ready to take a shot at becoming the next frontend developer for
				the one and only Rocky Balboa? We're looking for someone who can code
				with the same grit and determination as the Italian Stallion himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll be responsible for building and maintaining the
				Rocky Balboa official website, where fans can learn about the champ's
				latest fights, training regimes, and merchandise. You'll work closely
				with Rocky and his team to create a user-friendly and visually stunning
				website that will leave his fans feeling as pumped up as they do after a
				Rocky marathon.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be successful in this role, you'll need to be a creative and
				detail-oriented developer with a passion for the Rocky franchise. You'll
				need to have strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as
				experience with responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
				Knowledge of Rocky's opponents and triumphs is a plus!
			</p>
			<p>
				Working for Rocky Balboa is no easy feat, but the rewards are plenty.
				You'll have the opportunity to be a part of the Rocky legacy and
				contribute to the champ's ongoing success. Plus, you'll get to show off
				your skills to the entire world, just like Rocky did in the ring.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you think you have what it takes to be a frontend developer for
				Rocky Balboa, throw your hat in the ring and apply today! Yo Adrian,
				we're looking for you!
