				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Krypton is in need of a new frontend developer! As the premier planet in
				the universe, we need someone who can help us maintain our advanced
				technological society. If you're up to the challenge, keep reading!
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideal candidate for this position will have a strong understanding
				of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with modern frontend
				frameworks. You'll be working closely with our team of scientists and
				engineers to develop and maintain our planet's many web-based systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				But be warned: life on Krypton can be pretty intense. Our days are long
				(thanks to our planet's unusual rotation), and our atmosphere is a
				bit... well, let's just say it's not the most hospitable to humans. But
				don't worry, we'll provide you with a full-body suit that will keep you
				safe and comfortable.
			</p>
			<p>
				And if you're a fan of kryptonite, you're in luck! We've got plenty of
				it here, so you'll never have to worry about running out.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you're a frontend developer looking for a unique and exciting
				opportunity, look no further! Apply now and join the team on planet
				Krypton.
