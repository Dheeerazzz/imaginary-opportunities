				Are you a frontend developer who is ready to take your skills to the
				next level? Do you have a twisted sense of humor and love a good scare?
				If so, we have the perfect job for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Pennywise, the clown, is looking for a talented frontend developer to
				join our team of mischievous pranksters. In this role, you'll be
				responsible for creating and maintaining our website, as well as
				designing and implementing new features to keep our audience entertained
				and terrified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our ideal candidate is someone who is passionate about coding and has a
				strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You should also have
				experience with frontend frameworks such as React or Angular and be
				familiar with tools such as Git and Webpack. A sense of humor is a must,
				as we love to play pranks on our users and make them jump out of their
				seats.

				In this role, you'll have the opportunity to work with a small,
				tight-knit team of developers who are just as passionate about coding as
				they are about scaring people. You'll also have the opportunity to work
				with our creative team to come up with new, terrifying ideas for our
				website.

			<p>
				So if you're ready to take your frontend skills to the next level and
				join the dark side, apply now! Just be prepared to deal with some
				seriously spooky challenges.
