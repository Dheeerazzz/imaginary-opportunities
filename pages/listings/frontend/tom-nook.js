				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Tom Nook is looking for a frontend developer to join his team at Nook
				Inc. In this role, you'll be responsible for bringing the beauty of the
				Animal Crossing world to life through your coding skills. You'll work
				closely with our design team to create stunning user interfaces and
				interactive experiences that will leave our players feeling like they're
				truly living in a quaint little village.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for Tom Nook, you'll need to be a true Animal
				Crossing enthusiast. You'll need to know your way around the island,
				understand the ins and outs of fishing and bug catching, and be able to
				tell a perfect fruit from a not-so-perfect one. You'll also need a
				strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a keen eye
				for design and usability.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Nook Inc, we take our work seriously, but we also know how to have
				fun. As a member of our team, you'll have the opportunity to participate
				in fun office activities like "Fish Friday" and "Bug Catching
				Competition" to help you bond with your coworkers and enjoy the Animal
				Crossing experience even more.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're ready to join the Nook Inc team and help bring the magic of
				Animal Crossing to life, apply now! Please include a link to your
				portfolio and a brief explanation of your favorite Animal Crossing
				moment in your application.
