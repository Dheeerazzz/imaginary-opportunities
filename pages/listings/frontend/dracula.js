				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Attention all undead developers! Are you ready to join the ranks of the
				most terrifying tech team in the world? Look no further than Dracula's
				frontend development team!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for Dracula, you will be responsible for
				bringing the most spine-chilling designs to life on our hauntingly
				beautiful website. You will work closely with our design team of
				vampires, werewolves, and ghosts to create a user experience that will
				leave our visitors screaming for more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be put to the test as you
				build interactive elements and animations that will terrify and delight
				our users. You will also be expected to assist with maintaining and
				updating our site, so a keen eye for detail is a must.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to your technical skills, we are looking for someone with a
				sense of humor and a love of all things spooky. Our office is located in
				a creepy castle in the Transylvanian mountains, so a willingness to
				relocate is a plus.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you think you have what it takes to join our team of undead
				developers, please send your resume and a cover letter explaining why
				you would make a great addition to our team. We can't wait to hear from
				you!
			</p>
