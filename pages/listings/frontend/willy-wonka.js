				<strong>Frontend Developer (Entry-Level)</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Willy Wonka is looking for a frontend developer to join his team of
				chocolate-loving, Oompa Loompa-wrangling geniuses. If you have a passion
				for sweet treats and a flair for coding, we want you!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a frontend developer for Willy Wonka, you'll be responsible for
				building out the user interface for our delicious digital experiences.
				You'll work closely with our designers to bring their vision to life,
				and our back-end developers to make sure everything is running smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're looking for someone with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
				as well as a willingness to learn new technologies and a keen eye for
				detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, you'll have the opportunity to work on exciting projects
				like our e-commerce platform, recipe database, and virtual factory tour.
				You'll also get to help out with the occasional Oompa Loompa coding
				crisis (they're not as tech-savvy as you might think).
			</p>
			<p>
				So, if you're ready to take your career to the next level and join the
				Wonka team, apply now! And don't forget to include your favorite candy
				in your application - we're always looking for new flavors to try.
			</p>
